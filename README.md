## Overview

The Color Scheme Generator is a handy tool that allows users to input a base color and then receive a palette of complementary colors based on a chosen scheme. This tool leverages the power of the [TheColorAPI](https://www.thecolorapi.com/) to generate these palettes and presents them in a user-friendly manner.

This is a solo project as part of the Scrimba Frontend Career Path Module 8. 

## Features
